## Requirements

- [Speckle](https://github.com/speckleworks/SpeckleInstaller/releases/latest)
- GSA 10.0 for SpeckleGSA

## Installation

Latest build can be downloaded [here](https://gitlab.arup.com/speckle/specklestructuralsuite-installer/releases).

Sometimes the downloaded installer mysteriously dissappears when you try to run 
it, this is due to the antivirus software the Arup computers run. You can get around
this by copying the installer to `C:\TEMP` and running it from there.

## About Speckle
